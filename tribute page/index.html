            <!-- <p>Zaha Hadid was more than an architect; she was a visionary who transformed the world of architecture with her groundbreaking designs and innovative use of technology. Born in Baghdad in 1950, Hadid’s journey to becoming one of the most celebrated architects of the 21st century was marked by both triumphs and challenges. Her work continues to inspire and influence architects and enthusiasts around the globe.</p>
            <p>Hadid's architectural style is instantly recognizable for its futuristic and fluid forms. She often employed flowing lines and organic shapes, creating structures that seem to defy gravity. "There are 360 degrees, so why stick to one?" she famously said, reflecting her philosophy of exploring all possibilities in design. Her innovative approach has left an indelible mark on modern architecture, pushing the boundaries of what is possible.</p>
            <p>Hadid’s journey was not without obstacles. As a woman in a predominantly male field, she faced significant challenges. Yet, she persisted, breaking through barriers and paving the way for future generations of female architects. Her receipt of the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2004 was a historic moment, making her the first woman to receive this prestigious award. This achievement underscored her talent and determination, inspiring many to follow in her footsteps.</p> -->

            <!-- <p>Beyond her architectural achievements, Hadid was known for her vibrant personality and profound insights. "Architecture is really about well-being," she once said. "I think that people want to feel good in a space... On the one hand, it's about shelter, but it's also about pleasure." Her designs embody this philosophy, creating spaces that are not only functional but also evoke joy and wonder.
            Hadid's legacy extends far beyond her stunning buildings. She broke barriers, challenged norms, and redefined what was possible in architecture. Her work continues to inspire and influence new generations of architects, reminding us of the power of imagination and determination. Hadid’s vision and creativity have left a lasting impact on the world, ensuring that her legacy will endure for generations to come.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>Zaha Hadid's iconic projects include the Heydar Aliyev Center with its wave-like structure, the London Aquatics Centre's sweeping roof, the twinkling Guangzhou Opera House, the dynamic MAXXI Museum in Rome, and the sharply angled Vitra Fire Station. Each reflects her innovative and visionary approach to modern architecture.</p> -->
